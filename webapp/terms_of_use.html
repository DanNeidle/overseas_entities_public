  <h2>1) Terms of use</h2>

  <section>
    <h3>1. Who we are</h3>
    <p>We are Tax Policy Associates Ltd.</p>
    <p>Registered with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).</p>
    <p>Contact: info@taxpolicy.org.uk</p>
    <p>Address: 124 City Road, London, EC1V 2NX.</p>
    <p>Company number: 14053878.</p>
    <p>We do not normally make the use of our website or webapps subject to accepting terms of use, but in this case we are reliant upon HM Land Registry data, which is supplied under <a href="https://use-land-property-data.service.gov.uk/datasets/ocod/licence/view">licensing terms</a> imposed by HM Land Registry. </p>
    <p>HM Land Registry does not endorse this webapp, our analysis, or any conclusions drawn from it, and has no editorial control over it.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>2. What this webapp is (and isn’t)</h3>
    <p>This webapp helps users explore land in England &amp; Wales where the registered overseas owner appears not to have complied with the UK’s Register of Overseas Entities regime, based on our analysis of publicly available datasets.</p>
    <p>It is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>an information and research tool.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>legal advice, financial advice, or an allegation of wrongdoing about any individual; and</li>
      <li>a substitute for checking original records (Land Registry title registers, Companies House filings, and any relevant legislation).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>3. Your right to use the webapp</h3>
    <p>We give you a personal, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, revocable licence to access and use the webapp and its contents, subject to these Terms.</p>
    <p>We can suspend or end your access if you breach these Terms, or if we must do so to comply with the terms under which we access third‑party data.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>4. Key third‑party data terms you must follow</h3>
    <p>This webapp incorporates data from HM Land Registry’s “Overseas companies that own property in England and Wales” dataset (the “Land Registry dataset”). That dataset includes property addresses which are processed against Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium incorporating Royal Mail’s PAF®.</p>
    <p>Because of those third‑party rights, your use of property addresses shown in the webapp is restricted as follows:</p>

    <h4>4.1 Property address restrictions (Ordnance Survey / Royal Mail)</h4>
    <p>Unless you hold an applicable Public Sector Geospatial Agreement (PSGA) Member Licence from Ordnance Survey (and you comply with it), you may use property addresses from the webapp only:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>for personal and/or non‑commercial use; or</li>
      <li>for the effective management of land and properties, including maintaining ownership records and ensuring land transactions are promptly and accurately recorded; or</li>
      <li>for the prevention or detection of crime, the apprehension or prosecution of alleged offenders, legal proceedings in a court/tribunal, or complying with a court/tribunal order.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you want to use property addresses for any other purpose, you must obtain permission from Royal Mail (as referenced in the Land Registry licence terms).</p>

    <h4>4.2 HM Land Registry restrictions (how you may use the Land Registry dataset)</h4>
    <p>You must not use the Land Registry dataset (including any part of it shown in the webapp):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>to publish, commercially exploit, sell, license, or distribute the whole or any part of it as a standalone product/service (i.e., a product that is substantially the dataset itself without meaningful added value);</li>
      <li>for direct marketing, including contacting registered proprietors (or anyone else) to offer goods/services or make offers; or</li>
      <li>for any purpose that is contrary to law, regulation, or a regulatory code.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You must also not mislead others or suggest that HM Land Registry endorses you, your work, or this webapp.</p>

    <h4>4.3 No bulk copying, scraping, or dataset reconstruction</h4>
    <p>To protect third‑party rights and the integrity of the service, you must not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>scrape, crawl, harvest, or bulk‑download the webapp (including by automated means);</li>
      <li>systematically copy, export, or rebuild all or a substantial part of the underlying datasets (including addresses); or</li>
      <li>help anyone else do so.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Reasonable, limited quotation/extracts for lawful purposes may be allowed. Systematic reuse or reconstruction of the dataset is not. You remain responsible for complying with the address restrictions above and other applicable laws.</p>

    <h4>4.4 Don’t disrupt public services</h4>
    <p>You must not use Land Registry title numbers or other identifiers from the webapp in any way that could interrupt, damage, or impair HM Land Registry systems (or access to them), including by automated querying.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>5. Attribution you must keep</h3>
    <p>The webapp includes Land Registry material that must be attributed as follows:</p>
    <p>“Information produced by HM Land Registry © Crown copyright 2026 and used under licence.”</p>
    <p>If you publish extracts that include Land Registry material, you should also include (so far as practical) the source and the relevant date(s) of the data you used.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>6. Accuracy, fair use, and “don’t jump to conclusions”</h3>
    <p>We have taken care, but:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the underlying datasets contain errors and omissions;</li>
      <li>matching records across datasets can be uncertain; and</li>
      <li>legal compliance can be fact‑specific.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You agree:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>not to treat the webapp as definitive proof of ownership or illegality; and</li>
      <li>to verify any important point using original sources and professional advice where appropriate.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>7. Availability and changes</h3>
    <p>We may change, suspend, or withdraw the webapp at any time (for example, to fix issues, respond to legal requests, or because our upstream data access changes).</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>8. Governing law</h3>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. The courts of England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from them.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>2) Privacy Notice (UK GDPR / Data Protection Act 2018)</h2>
  <p>This section explains how we handle personal data when you register for and use the webapp.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>1. Data controller</h3>
    <p>Tax Policy Associates Ltd is the data controller for personal data processed for the webapp.</p>
    <p>Contact details are as above.</p>
    <p>ICO registration: ZB329271</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>2. What personal data we collect</h3>
    <p>When you register and use the webapp, we will collect your name, email address, and your IP address, because the licence under which we access HM Land Registry data purports to require this.</p>

<p>HM Land Registry also claims the right to inspect our records (including your personal data) “for audit purposes”. We do not believe this is lawful under UK GDPR. We will not provide HM Land Registry with your personal data for general audit purposes, and will provide only redacted records.</p>

<p>HM Land Registry further claims a right of access for the prevention or detection of crime. We will comply with such requests only where they are specific, particularised, and lawful under UK GDPR.</p>

<p>UK GDPR overrides any contractual term that would require unlawful processing of personal data.</p>


<p>We think it is important that users understand how public bodies sometimes seek to use licensing terms to expand access to personal data beyond what data protection law permits. We do not agree with that approach, and we will not comply with it.</p>
    
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>3. What we do not collect (no behavioural tracking)</h3>
    <p>We do not aim to log or analyse “what you do” inside the webapp (for example: the properties you click, the filters you apply, or the searches you run). We technically cannot do this, as the webapp runs entirely on your device. All we know is that you used the webapp.</p>
    <p>Any preference settings or session state that the webapp stores for convenience are stored locally on your device (for example, in your browser storage), not in our analytics profiles.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>4. How long we keep personal data</h3>
    <p>We keep personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes above.</p>
    <p>The Land Registry dataset licence purports to require retention of End-User Records (including IP addresses) during the licence and for 12 months afterwards.</p>

<p>We retain personal data only to the extent and for so long as this is compatible with UK GDPR. Data is deleted or anonymised sooner where it is no longer necessary or lawful to retain it.</p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>5. Your rights</h3>
    <p>Under UK GDPR, you may have rights including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>access to your personal data</li>
      <li>correction of inaccurate data</li>
      <li>deletion (in some circumstances)</li>
      <li>restriction of processing (in some circumstances)</li>
      <li>objection to processing based on legitimate interests (in some circumstances)</li>
      <li>data portability (in some circumstances)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise rights, contact: info@taxpolicy.org.uk.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>6. Complaints</h3>
    <p>If you have concerns, contact us first. You can also complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>7. Cookies</h3>
    <p>We use only cookies (or similar storage) that are necessary to run the webapp (for example, session/login cookies).</p>
